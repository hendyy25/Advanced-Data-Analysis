# Advanced Data Analysis

This repository contains data science projects and their discriptions. It is composed of:

## - MySQL Project
I learned MySQL from an online course. I finally worked on a database and created a report for how the company can improve its business decisions. Some of the topics are:
* Knowledge about SQL basics for working with a single table. You will learn tdhe key commands to filter a table in many different ways. 
* How to combine data from multiple tables together.
* How to aggregate data using SQL functions.
* How to write subquries and temporary tables.

## A/B Testing
Applied Python to:
* Find descriptive statistics properties, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. 
* Implemented inferential statistics techniques, such as binomial distribution, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and regression. Summarized the results based on the data and gave a data-driven conclusion. 

Worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Tableau
Learned the basic features of Tableau, including different design and visualization techniques. Applied topics, such as aggregations, hierarchies, marks & filters, dual axis, map configaration, groups & sets, calculated fields, and table calculations. Designed worksheets, dashboards, and a story based on these skills.
